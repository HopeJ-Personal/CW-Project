The version format for the CW Project otherwise known as "Creative Witchcraft SMP"! Inside the changelogs, you will find folders
- The versions are formatted by 3 values (X.Y.Z(ru))
    X - The first value `X` is the release type, this value can be one of three main types; Of these three there is Alpha, Beta,
    and Release.

        Alpha (1) - In general, an alpha version or release of an "early access" mod pack intends to do something particular,
                    and mostly does so, yet is not guaranteed to do so fully but is functional enough for release.

        Beta (2) - A beta release is the alpha version of the product for the mod maker is satisfied with the condition the product
                   is in, and is less likely to get major updates to fix existing stuff and is likely in final QA Iterations before
                   release.

        Release (3) - A release is the distribution of the final version or the newest version of a mod pack/mod. Generally speaking
                      the mod pack is a modification of the latest beta and from that point on will be finalized and refined
                      updates are found.
    
    Y - The second value found in the tenth's place is `Y` and represents the large updates or in other words finalized changes that
        likely will not be changed in large ways in a while and can be expected to stay or at least not be removed entirely.
    
    Z - The last value found in the hundredths' place is `Z` and represents the sub-version; within the sub-version, you can see
        smaller changes such as quality of life, small changes, backend fixes, patches, balancing, and community-requested changes.
    
    ru - RU while not being in every release version is just a way to separate reuploads for issues like corruption or backups and
         and can generally changelogs are generally blank but still are considered "latest versions" as they still can contain
         uncategorized changes.
